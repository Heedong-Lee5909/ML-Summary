# Machine Learning Course Summary

## 1. Introduction to Machine Learning
- **Definition**: Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI).  
  It allows computers to use data and algorithms to imitate human learning and decision-making, improving accuracy over time.
- **Applications**:
  - **Healthcare**: Doctors use ML to prescribe correct medicines.
  - **Finance**: Banks use ML to decide loan approvals.
  - **E-commerce**: Businesses use ML to generate customer recommendations.

## 2. Types of Learning
- **Supervised Learning**: Uses labeled data (e.g., regression, classification).  
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finds patterns without labels (e.g., clustering, dimension reduction).  
- **Semi-Supervised Learning**: Uses a mix of labeled and unlabeled data.  
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learns through trial and error with rewards and penalties.

## 3. Machine Learning Pipeline
- Data preprocessing  
- Model building  
- Model evaluation  
- Hyperparameter optimization  
- Deployment and implementation

ML tools provide modules to handle big data, perform statistical analysis, and make predictions efficiently.

## 4. Regression
- **Definition**: Models the relationship between a continuous target variable and explanatory features.
- **Types**:
  - **Simple Regression**: One independent variable → one dependent variable.
  - **Multiple Regression**: Two or more independent variables.
  - **Logistic Regression**: Predicts categorical outcomes (classification tasks).
- **Equation (Linear Regression)**:  
  y_hat = θ0 + θ1·x1 + θ2·x2 + ... + θn·xn

## 5. Classification
- **Definition**: Supervised ML method that predicts discrete class labels.  
- **Applications**:
  - Email filtering  
  - Speech-to-text  
  - Handwriting recognition  
  - Biometric ID  
  - Document classification  

**Key Algorithms**:  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Uses labeled data points to classify or regress.  
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Maps data into multidimensional space, effective in speech recognition, anomaly detection, noise filtering.  
- **Decision Trees**: Tree-like model; nodes = tests, branches = outcomes, leaves = classes.  
- **Regression Trees**: Like decision trees, but predict continuous values instead of discrete labels.

## 6. Clustering, Dimension Reduction, and Feature Engineering
- **Clustering**: Groups data points into clusters (e.g., user segmentation, market analysis).  
- **Dimension Reduction**: Reduces dataset features while preserving important info.  
  - Benefits: Easier visualization, less noise, better model interpretability.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Improves performance by transforming, creating, or selecting features.

---

## 7. Model Evaluation
- **Classification Metrics**:
  - Accuracy  
  - Confusion Matrix  
  - Precision  
  - Recall  
- **Regression Evaluation**: Compare predictions vs actual continuous values (e.g., MSE, RMSE).  
- **Unsupervised Evaluation**: Assess quality of discovered patterns (e.g., clustering validity).

---

## 8. Model Validation
- **Goal**: Ensure model generalizes well to unseen data.  
- **Data Snooping**: Checking test performance before finalizing the model → leads to data leakage.  
- **Validation Strategy**:
  - Train on training data  
  - Tune hyperparameters on validation data  
  - Final test only on unseen test data  

---

## 9. Course Wrap-Up
- Each module provides **summaries** and **glossaries** for quick reference.  
- Reinforce learning by completing practice and graded assessments.  
- Apply knowledge in **hands-on labs** and a **final project**.

## 10. Key Takeaways
- ML enables data-driven predictions across industries.  
- Choice of learning method depends on problem type, data, and resources.  
- Pipelines streamline ML workflow from preprocessing to deployment.  
- Regression → continuous targets; Classification → categorical labels.  
- Advanced methods like clustering and dimension reduction enhance model performance.  
- Proper validation avoids overfitting and data leakage.  
- Metrics guide model performance assessment.
