# Evaluating Unsupervised Learning Models: Heuristics and Techniques

## Overview
Evaluating unsupervised learning models is challenging because there are no predefined labels or ground truths. Methods like clustering and dimensionality reduction aim to discover hidden patterns, requiring careful evaluation to ensure pattern quality and model stability.

## Key Points
- **Stability**: Reliable models produce similar results despite dataset variations.
- **No single approach**: Combine heuristics, metrics, domain expertise, and visualization.

## Clustering Evaluation

### Types of Heuristics
1. **Internal Metrics** – Use only input data.
2. **External Metrics** – Use ground truth labels.
3. **Generalizability/Stability** – Test cluster consistency.
4. **Dimensionality Reduction Visualization** – e.g., PCA, t-SNE, UMAP.
5. **Cluster-assisted Learning** – Refine via supervised learning.

### Internal Metrics
- **Silhouette Score**: Measures cohesion vs. separation (-1 to 1). Higher is better.
- **Davies-Bouldin Index**: Ratio of compactness to separation. Lower is better.
- **Inertia (K-means)**: Sum of within-cluster variances. Lower is better, but more clusters reduce variance.

**Example**:  
- Well-separated clusters: Silhouette 0.84, DB Index 0.22 → Excellent quality.  
- Dispersed clusters: Silhouette 0.58, DB Index 0.6 → Reasonable quality.

### External Metrics
- **Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)**: -1 to 1. 1 = perfect match.
- **Normalized Mutual Information (NMI)**: 0 to 1. Measures shared info.
- **Fowlkes-Mallows Index (FMI)**: Geometric mean of precision & recall.

## Dimensionality Reduction Evaluation
- **Explained Variance Ratio (PCA)**: Variance captured by components.
- **Reconstruction Error**: Lower = better info preservation.
- **Neighborhood Preservation**: Maintains relationships from high-dimensional space.

**Example**: PCA on Iris dataset:  
- PC1 nearly separates species.  
- First two PCs capture most variance; remaining add little.

## Conclusion
Effective evaluation of unsupervised learning models combines multiple metrics, domain knowledge, and visualization. Stability and interpretability are crucial for reliable results.
